This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```


```{r}
Qs <- ss1
mapQ <- read.csv("datasets//Question_mappings.csv")


Qs <- unique(Qs[c("QUESTION","TITLE_E")])
Qs <- merge(mapQ,Qs)

Qs <- Qs %>%
  select(TakingAction_AreasOfImprovement,QSubTheme_E,QUESTION,TITLE_E) %>%
  filter(TakingAction_AreasOfImprovement != "") %>%
  arrange(TakingAction_AreasOfImprovement,QSubTheme_E,QUESTION)

as_tibble(Qs)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
